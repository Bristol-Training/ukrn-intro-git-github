title: "Creating directories"
---


Git is a tool that is used to version control a *directory of files*. To start, we
must first create a directory that will contain the files that will be version controlled.

You can call the directory anything you want. For this workshop, we will call
the directory `versioned_dir`. To create this, type into the command window;

```{.bash}
mkdir versioned_dir
```

This will have created a new directory called `versioned_dir`. We now need to change 
into this directory. Please do that by typing this into the command window;

```{.bash}
cd versioned_dir
```

## Initialising version control

The next step is to tell git that we want to start version controlling the files in this
directory. We do that by initialise git using the `git init` command. Type this into the 
command window;

```{.bash}
git init
```

You should see something like this printed as output to the screen;

```
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/ab01234/versioned_dir/.git/
```

This has told git to initialise a new [repository](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/repository) in which versions of files in this directory will be saved. This repository
is empty, as we have not yet saved any versions.
