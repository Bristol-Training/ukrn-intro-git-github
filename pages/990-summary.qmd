Congratulations - you've now learned enough to start using git to 
version control your files and back them up to a secure location.

Now that you know how git works from the command line, you are ready to start using
git within a graphical interface. All of the git graphical interfaces are just running
the above git commands. There are many graphical interfaces available, a lot of
which are [described here](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).

[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is very good, as is the
[GitHub Mobile App](https://github.com/mobile). I also really like the integration
of git into [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
[Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/) is also recommended,
as is [git-cola](https://git-cola.github.io/).

In short, choose the tool that works best for you. Have a play
with them and find the one that works for you!
